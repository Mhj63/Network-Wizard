## 📌 Overview

**Network Wizard** is a Java-based tool designed to demonstrate and enhance my understanding of core programming concepts. This project serves as a practical application of what I’ve learned in my computer programming course, specifically focusing on debugging, input validation, logic implementation, and terminal interaction.

The program helps users:
- Calculate VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) subnetting.
- Convert CIDR notation to subnet masks.
- Validate IP addresses and calculate usable IP ranges.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Clean and structured Java codebase
- ✅ VLSM Subnet Calculator
- ✅ CIDR to Subnet Mask Converter
- ✅ Input validation for all IP octets and CIDR entries
- ✅ Dynamic calculation of:
  - Network ID
  - First and last usable IP addresses
  - Broadcast address
  - Usable hosts
  - Wastage IPs
- ✅ "q" key to quit any section
- ✅ Clean terminal interface
- ✅ Compiled into a standalone `.exe` using **Launch4j**

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the `.exe` file (compiled using Launch4j).
2. Simply double-click to launch — no setup or installation required.
3. Follow the prompts in the console window.
   - To quit, press `q` at any time.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java (JDK 8+)
- Launch4j (for .exe conversion)

For VLSM Press (1):
For CIDR to Subnet Mask Press (2):
To Quit Press (q):

Welcome to the CIDR to Subnet Mask Converter!

Enter the CIDR to convert it into a subnet mask (24 for /24) :
24
Your CIDR is /24
Your Subnet Mask is: 255.255.255.0
Do you wish to quit out of the program?
Press (q) to quit.
